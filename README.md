# COMP2604 Labs
Here be all the C projects and source files for my COMP 2604 Operating Systems course. All example files will use the following format:

-C-source files - **sample_source.c**

-Executable binary files - **sample_bin** (no extension)

## Compilation on Unix
Be sure to have the GNU C Compiler (GCC) installed. Usually comes prepackaged with most Linux distributions or Unix-based operating systems (e.g., MacOS). If not, figure out how to get it installed. Otherwise, any standard C compiler works just fine. 

Compile with GCC using:

```gcc sample_source.c -o sample_bin```

To run *sample_bin*, use:

```./sample_bin```

Familiarise oneself with typical POSIX/Unix commands to enhance terminal usage and improve efficiency of debugging code

## Compilation on Windows
Not a single clue. Do some research


### Good luck
